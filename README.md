# Tender Pricing App (Full UI)

This is your full tender-pricing app with:

- Original UI layout preserved
- Default **Double-sided loading = 20%**
- Default **tier count = 1** (you can add more tiers from the UI)
- New option at the top to **choose which Excel row is the header** (e.g. row 2).

Run locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Then use it exactly as before.
